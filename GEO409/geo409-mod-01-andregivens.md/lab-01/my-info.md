## My favorite mapping class or assignment?

In Fall 2021, I analyzed and mapped the Preston Ave. Corridor in Louisville, Kentucky for GEO 509. The goal was to find different factors that contributed to the current statistics around the area. For example, my group analyzed different food banks and job centers to determine why the rate of poverty and the percentage of high school and bachelor's degree contributed to low income districts.

## Why am I taking this course, and what do I want from it?

Originally, this course was to fullfill a course requirement for the Mapping & GIS minor. However, I completed GEO 405G to subsitute the requirement. I decided to take this class anyway so I can gain more experience in using GIS technology. 

## My two favorite maps and visualizations.
